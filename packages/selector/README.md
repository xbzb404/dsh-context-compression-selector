# dsh-context-compression-selector

The installable Product Bundle for the unofficial community DeepSeek Harness context-compression selector.

**0.1.1 highlights:** DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash is supported on the Harness default route — `deepseek-flash` resolves an exact bundled tokenizer instead of failing closed, so exact-gated compression is no longer a no-op on the default model. Vision image-token arithmetic follows the official V4.1 image processor, and `deepseek-flash` gains official pricing rows.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-context-compression-selector@latest
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

This one command automatically installs the exact `dsh-context-compression-selector-runtime` dependency. The Bundle contributes Host settings, the Web UI, and a reversible preset overlay. All presets except the exact built-in `minimal` id receive the compression stack; switching non-Minimal presets preserves the saved selector settings. Minimal pauses plugin compression without deleting the setting.

Verified compatibility: DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2` and `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.5`, Node `^22.19.0 || >=24`. No Harness core patch is required.
