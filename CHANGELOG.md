# Changelog

All notable changes use this file. The project follows semantic versioning after `0.1.0`.

## 0.2.0-rc.1 - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- **Re-targeted the whole project at DeepSeek Harness `0.2.0-rc.2`.** The Bundle now publishes compression as **derived preset variants** declared through `AgentPresetRegistry.register()` instead of decorating preset resolution. The `0.1.x` overlay — a temporary directory, mtime/size standing keys, `AsyncLocalStorage`, and a `resolve()` method snapshot — is gone, because 0.2.0 makes the registry the only authority over preset composition and no longer lets a plugin rewrite someone else's preset.
- The Bundle's profile row id is now `context-compression`, which is also its settings namespace. In 0.2.0 a settings form is served per profile-row entry id, so the row the Bundle installs and the form the browser selector reads are the same document; the previous `context-compression-selector-bundle` id produced a form no client could resolve.
- Settings are read through `SettingsForms.describe()` when the Host does not expose `get(namespace)`. `describe()` is the only read API `SettingsForms` offers, and its descriptors key on the profile row's entry id. A host still exposing `get(namespace)` is honored first, so a mixed deployment keeps working.
- Preset variant ids are stable (`<source>--compression`) and reference-counted, so reinstalling the row replaces the same variants rather than accumulating generations, and the built-in row and the Bundle row never install two compression stacks.
- Client slot registration now goes through a locally declared structural `slots` face, and the selector no longer gates on session preset capability: `settings.section` in 0.2.0 receives only `{ close }` with `scope: 'root'`, so a `settings.section` component cannot observe the current session's preset.

### Added

- `installCompressionVariants()`, `canonicalCompressionRows()`, and `resolveCompressionModulePaths()` replace the removed `PresetOverlayStore`; a variant's plugin rows are emitted as `file:` URLs, which is required because the registry mounts rows under the declaring Loader's base.
- An end-to-end spec drives the real `Loader`, `Include`, `Group`, `LlmRuntime`, `SessionStore`, `SessionProjections`, `SystemPrompt`, `ToolRuntime`, `AgentRegistry`, `AgentLoop`, `CommandRuntime`, `TokenMeter`, and `AgentPresetRegistry`, and asserts that an Agent mounted on a variant carries `toolResultPruner`, `compaction`, the `context_compression_retrieve` tool, and the `compact` command while the source preset stays byte-identical.
- A runtime spec covers a Host that exposes only `describe()` — the 0.2.0 read surface — so a regression to `get()` or a row-id/namespace mismatch fails loudly.

### Fixed

- **Preset rows emitted by the plugin used native paths and silently never loaded on Windows.** A row name of `C://...//lib//index.js` is not a valid ESM specifier, so the Loader reported the row as `never started` and the variant came up without any compression at all. Rows are now `file:` URLs.
- `AgentLoop.create()` is awaited and resolves a `Promise<Agent>`; subagent child prefixes are read as `session.inheritedEventCount` with `snapshotEvents()`, since 0.2.0 removed the `seedLength` header mirror and the public `events` array.

### Removed

- `packages/selector/tests/standing-generation.host.spec.ts`, which exercised the 0.1.x standing-key machinery that no longer exists on the plugin side. Its real-harness coverage is replaced by `preset-overlay-loader.e2e.host.spec.ts`.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-23

### Added

- DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash support for the `deepseek-flash` default route: it now resolves an exact bundled tokenizer (`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash` @ `dba1be0a40aa45a94ad051997016db3960a90277`) instead of failing closed, so exact-gated compression is no longer a no-op on the Harness default model.
- Official `deepseek-flash` pricing rows (USD `0.003/0.15/0.6` off-peak and `0.006/0.3/1.2` peak; CNY `0.02/1/4` off-peak and `0.04/2/8` peak) with `modelVersion` `DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`, so adaptive cost authority is enabled on that route.

### Changed

- The bundled vision asset is re-anchored from the retired `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp` repository to `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash` (`packages/runtime/assets/deepseek-v4.1-flash/`). The `tokenizer.json` and `tokenizer_config.json` bytes are unchanged; only provenance and the license file move.
- `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` are now served by the same V4.1-Flash artifact as `deepseek-flash`. `deepseek-v4-pro` keeps its own V4-Pro tokenizer, and the only V4-Pro change is dropping the retired `deepseek-v4-flash` alias from its manifest `modelIds`; the "untouched" part of this entry applies to `deepseek-v4-pro` only — its tokenizer bytes, `modelVersion`, and prices are unchanged.
- The two retired aliases `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` are now **billed at the Flash price** instead of the withdrawn V4-Flash tuple, matching the official pricing page ("billed at the Flash price" / "按 Flash 价格计费"). New: USD `0.003/0.15/0.6` off-peak and `0.006/0.3/1.2` peak, CNY `0.02/1/4` off-peak and `0.04/2/8` peak, `modelVersion` `DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`. Previous: USD `0.007/0.22/0.66` off-peak and `0.014/0.44/1.32` peak, CNY `0.05/1.5/4.5` off-peak and `0.10/3.0/9.0` peak, `modelVersion` `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731`. This is not cosmetic: the cache-hit/cache-miss spread narrows from `0.213` to `0.147`, which can turn a previously authorized Adaptive History decision on these routes into `cache-risk-not-clearly-paid-back`. `deepseek-v4-pro` pricing is deliberately unchanged.
- The `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` routes are a documented compatibility period only: the official pricing page marks those models as retired and says their requests are served by V4.1-Flash. If the aliases are withdrawn, the tokenizer mapping and the pricing rows for them must be re-evaluated together.
- Vision image-token arithmetic is re-ported to the official V4.1 `image_processor.py`: the per-image cap moves 384 → 1024 tokens, the minimum-pixel floor 147456 → 295936, and the aspect clamp is gone because the official config pins `vision_max_wh_ratio` to `null`. The block length is now exactly `nLlmH * (nLlmW + 1) + 2` and is independent of the serialized position, so the position-dependent compress/odd-row/alignment padding and the `safe_resize` budget loop are removed. Measured divergence from the previous port: 800×600 338–341 → 317, 1024×1024 346–349 → 652, 14×14 114–117 → 184.
- The vision estimator identity is bumped to `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash/image-token-estimate` @ `dba1be0a40aa45a94ad051997016db3960a90277:v1` so audit rows from the two arithmetics cannot be confused. The fixed 256-token malformed-image fallback is unchanged.
- `vision-golden.json` is regenerated by executing the official V4.1 Python implementation; the position sweep is retained as explicit position-independence evidence rather than a varying-count sweep.

### Fixed

- The selector's Adaptive price disclosure now reports `2026-09-23`, matching the re-verified price catalog. It still said `2026-08-25` after the catalog was re-checked, and a client-test regex pinned that literal, so the stale date was locked in rather than detected.
- The packed release smoke now drives `deepseek-flash` — the Harness default model id — instead of the legacy `deepseek-v4-flash` alias. The gate previously passed while never exercising the route this release exists to fix, so a regression on the default route would not have been caught. Alias mapping remains covered by the unit suite.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Stable release of DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision tokenizer integration for `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`, including exact text counting and bounded image-token estimates.
- User-configurable model-driven Auto Compact threshold in the selector settings section.
- Auto Compact threshold linkage for each standard profile's History / micro-compact watermarks and related compression parameters.

### Changed

- The threshold editor now uses one direct numeric input; the slider and fixed quick-value buttons were removed.
- Runtime session-event access supports both the established Harness `events` accessor and the newer `snapshotEvents()` public API.

## 0.1.0-beta.4 - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Support the official DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.5` public API while retaining compatibility with the existing `0.1.1-rc.2` peer range. The plugin now owns the two small immutable-value helpers that the newer Harness no longer exports, and uses the same public `context-compression` namespace literal accepted by both Settings implementations. No Harness core code is modified.

## 0.1.0-beta.3 - 2026-09-01

### Scope

This is a staged release. Exact **text-class** token counting for `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`, best-effort bounded **vision-class image** estimates, and the Auto Compact threshold/UI/audit work are delivered. Exact image measurement remains **BLOCKED upstream**: the current measurement seam exposes neither the adapter's projected request-image dimensions nor the absolute serialized position, so estimates cannot be promoted to `exact-tokenizer`.

### Added

- DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision support for `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` via a separately bundled official tokenizer pinned at `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp` revision `6821d6ad3681a4b137b066b76094fa82ebd0a380`. Text, reasoning, tool-call arguments, and pure-text tool results are counted exactly; image-bearing tool-result candidates stay fail-open.
- Vision image-token arithmetic ported line-by-line from the official `inference/image_processor.py` (patch size 14, downsample 3, 384-token cap, min pixels 147456, 8:1 aspect clamp, and position-dependent alignment padding), validated against golden fixtures generated by executing the official Python implementation. Valid intrinsic dimensions now produce `tokenizer-estimate` at the midpoint of all four alignment residues with a 384-token per-image upper bound; malformed or unevaluable dimensions use a documented 256-token fallback. Mixed text/image surfaces aggregate exact text and estimated images without promoting them to exact.
- `autoCompact.thresholdPercent` setting (default 80, integer 50–90, step 1) with one shared validation contract across the settings UI, the persisted schema, and the runtime resolver. The editor lives inside the context-compression selector settings section.
- Standard-profile History linkage to the Auto Compact watermark: `A = floor(C × a)` rescales the History trigger, minimum reclaim, and recent-token tail; `D = floor(A × 0.875)` replaces the fixed 0.7 capacity-pressure ratio as the micro-compact last-chance gate; one batch must justify its cache break by pulling the complete request back below the deadline. Defaults at 80% reproduce the previous numbers exactly.
- The preset overlay writes the saved threshold into the generated `compaction-basic` composition as `thresholdRatio` (with `retainRatio` pinned at 0.16) and, from the same read, into the plugin runtime's deployment config as `autoCompactThresholdPercent`, so one standing generation never runs Auto Compact and micro compact on two different thresholds. Any generation-identity change — threshold, source, or module paths, including equal-length ones — produces a new standing composition generation. Deterministic identity-derived stamps use an 8-hex whole-second window; equal-prefix identities can collide in that first window on a coarse filesystem, so the overlay observes the staging file's real `mtimeMs+size` key and escalates to later hash windows before the atomic rename. Content, permissions, and the final unique stamp are complete before publication; already-running sessions keep their frozen policy.
- `policy-resolved` audits now record the Auto Compact coordination facts (threshold percent, `A`, `D`, parameter source — including `deployment-override`/`mixed` when deployment config replaces linked History watermarks), the routed provider/model, and the bundled tokenizer identity.
- Persisted settings reject present-but-invalid sections (`profile: null`, `custom: null`, own-property `undefined`) before any schema default can absorb them; a malformed stored document freezes the session losslessly (`profile: off`, audited as `settingsInvalidFallback: lossless-off`) instead of silently enabling the lossy Balanced default. The browser decoder applies the same rule and canonicalizes legacy Custom v1/v2 documents to the same v3 document the runtime resolver produces.
- The History planner returns a discriminated outcome, and `component-evaluation` audits distinguish the full skip taxonomy: `below-profile-trigger`, `below-micro-deadline`, `exact-tokenizer-unavailable`, `no-safe-candidates` (only recovery-tool output or already-cleared results), `protected-working-set` (everything inside the protected tail), `insufficient-reclaim` and `cannot-reach-deadline-target` (with the reached/required token numbers), `adaptive-cost-rejected`, and `recovery-tool-unavailable`.

### Known limitations

- Images never claim exact counts. The official expansion depends on the absolute prompt position (system prompt, chat-template framing, adapter image handles) and on the adapter's final request-image projection (including per-route `imagePixelBudget`/`imageDetail` overrides and byte-cap reprojection), none of which is exposed through the current measurement seam. Intrinsic/default estimates may therefore differ materially from provider accounting. Upstream capability requests remain projected request-image dimensions and the absolute serialized position exposed to token-meter extensions.
- History skips the whole batch whenever any tool-result candidate lacks an exact count, including image-bearing candidates, even though sibling text candidates are individually exact.
- Custom remains manual token mode; its History parameters do not follow the Auto Compact watermark.
- A vision token breakdown UI is not shipped; image estimates and the intrinsic alignment diagnostic are available on the measured token view, while lossy rewrite proofs still require exact counts.

### Deferred

- Audit `modality` field and the tokenizer artifact SHA-256 inside audit records (the audits already carry the routed provider/model and tokenizer identity).
- Publishing the (now complete) runtime skip-reason taxonomy as a user-facing documentation table.
- Custom-profile display of the A/D watermarks and an above-D warning; Custom remains fully manual.
- Vision token breakdown UI and promotion of image estimates to exact measurement.

## 0.1.0-beta.2 - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Resolve the official DeepSeek V4 Flash tokenizer route so Fresh and Aggregate can evaluate tool results for the supported V4 models.
- Run Cache Strict History at the real request boundary once its configured capacity-pressure condition is met; trigger the capacity condition at 70% routed-context utilization.
- Disable Harness-native head/middle/tail tool-result pruning whenever a selector profile is active, leaving the selector as the sole tool-result compactor.

### Changed

- Protect the newest 10 agent tool calls and a 64,000-token tool-result tail window before History/microcompact rewrites older results.

## 0.1.0-beta.1 - 2026-08-27

### Added

- One-install DeepSeek Harness Product Bundle backed by a separate exact-version runtime package.
- Web profile selector with preset-stable settings and an explicit built-in Minimal exception.
- Fresh, Aggregate, routine/capacity-aware History, Native tool-result pruning, and default-off Custom TailTrim.
- Standard-event TailTrim protocol using `compaction/prune` plus recoverable `user/message` replacement.
- Plugin-owned `context_compression_retrieve` recovery tool.
- Structured, content-free policy, evaluation, rewrite, failure, and Native auto-compact audit records.
- Pinned official DeepSeek V4 tokenizer assets with runtime SHA-256 validation and upstream license.
- Public-API component E2E, preset/Minimal, and parent/fork/spawn cache-prefix regression tests.

### Compatibility

- Verified against DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2` public packages.
- Exact tokenizer mapping is currently limited to `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`.

### Known limitations

- Adaptive ordinary History fails closed when public request-level route/cache evidence is incomplete; capacity pressure remains a separate safety override.
- Cache-prefix tests prove native fork inheritance and identical serialized prefixes, not a provider-specific cache allocation or a guaranteed DeepSeek cache hit.
- Settings snapshots and first-exposure decisions are process-local to the mounted runtime.
